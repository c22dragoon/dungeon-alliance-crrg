# Dungeon Alliance - Community Rules Reference Guide

This is a LaTeX document which acts as a rules cross reference guide for the Dungeon Alliance board game. The template itself can be utilized by anyone to offer similar document possibly for some other board game. I will most likely clean it up and make a separate GitHub project out of it for easier utilization.

## Tools and generating the PDF document

To render the PDF, I have used XeLaTex (MiKTeX 2.9) from Texmaker (http://www.xm1math.net/texmaker/).
